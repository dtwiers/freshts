# FreshTS

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

FreshTS was developed as a way to fix common problems I've seen in the Typescript ecosystem in ways that abide by my opinions that I've formed over the years. Existing solutions, I've found, are either:

- too unapproachable (many FP libraries can get quite academic & pedantic)
- too large (I've broken most of these up into pretty small libraries; import only what you need)
- too unopinionated (Every redux store I've ever seen is different)

This repository is definitely in its early stages - I'm just now starting to write some documentation and tests. One could argue that it's in "early alpha" stage - it's code that should generally mostly work, but I don't know that and it has never been run.

Feel free to PR into this library however you see fit; it's a spare-time-only type of project however, so I can't give any guarantees as to how timely I'll be about specific questions or comments.
